### Description
Front end application that links to the red-light back end. The two combine to create an app that will help schools coordinate parent pick-up at the end of the school day, which is a much longer process in the time of Covid, while schools attempt to keep contact limited between children in different classes/pods. The app will provide a more organized, streamlined way of teachers being notified it’s time to send a child out when their ride arrives (whether that be a parent or a bus).
